# aircoach-wallet-pass

Air coach does not offer the addition of the qr code to apple wallet. This repo leverages python to extract the existing pdf ticket/document and create an apple wallet pass for the same. 

The objective of this project is as follows:

- To read and extract the qr code and metadata info from the ticket pdf. 
- To be able to generate the wallet pass from the ticket
- To load and use it as a wallet pass.
